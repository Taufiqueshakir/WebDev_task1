 <h1 style="color: aqua;text-align: center;background-color: rgb(225, 19, 43);">Amazon Business portfolio     
            <p></b><h3> Amazon competes to be "Earth's most customer-centric company,"
    offering the largest online selection at the most affordable prices(overview,n.d.)
    The internet services and rewtailer made its opening debut in july 1995 as an online book store
    and has since made tremendous growth, taking over as the most valuable retailer valued at $250 
    billion (KANTOR & Streitfeld, 2015) the first public options were offered in may 1997 on NASDAQ
    ("Amazon.com,"n.d) and have since grown over 10 time their original value, expriencing sales of 
    $107 Billion in 2015 (Market Watch, 2016).</h3></p> 

    <p><h3> Originally incorporated under the name cadabra (as in Abracadabra) the company
        was reincorporated a year later as Amazon, after a lawyer misheard the original name as Cadaver
        (Quinn, 2015).In 1995 the first book sold through the website was titled "Fluid Concepts and 
        creative Analogies" by Douglas Hofstadter and was delivered from Bezos'garage to the locol post 
        office by hand (Quinn,2015). The company has seen many successes in recent years, such as the 
        launch of the first international sites in the UK and Germany in October,2003, and the introduction
        of Amazon Prime in February,2005 ("Amazon Media Room History & Timeline," 1996).The Kindle Application
        was first introduced for iPhone in March 2009 and that same year, they acquired Zappos.com 
        ("Amazon Media Room: History & Timeline,1996") Amazon continues to innovate with such 
        announcements as Local Express Delivery in October, 2009 and services to compete with big name 
        companies office Prime Instant Videos for Prime Members in February,2011("Amazon Media Room: History & 
        Timeline," 1996).</h3></p>

    <p><h3> The Amazon logo has been re-imagined over the years from its original basis on its 
        namesake, the Amazon River, to align the idea of the company with something that stretches across
        a great distance (Ranj,2016). Part of the charm of the modern logo, redesigned by Turner Duckworth,
        is the smile connecting two letters, subtly affirming that Amazon sells "Everything from A to Z
        ("Visual Wit,"2013)." </h3></p>
